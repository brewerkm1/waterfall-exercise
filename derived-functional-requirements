Who are the actors: President Nolan, the 100 guests, the chefs, us, the wait staff
Where will it be done: The Millenium Center
Break the event down into a series of milestones:
a.	Adjust ingredients from the recipe to serve all guests. You may want to choose to intentionally buy more ingredients than the minimum you need in case something happens.
b.	Calculate cost of ingredients and chef pay.
c.	Adjust prep time by calculating the number of chefs that will be working and how much they will need to cook, and add a bit of extra time to that just in case something happens.
d.	Schedule a date and time in the Millenium Center.
e.	Send the invites via email, ask for RSVP.
f.	On the day of, subtract your prep time estimate from 7:00 am and start preparing then, and be ready when people arrive.
g.	Serve the pancakes to every attendee.
h.	Check in on the attendees and make sure they do not need anything.
i.	After they are gone, clean up the Millenium Center.
j.	Pay the staff.
Break each milestone down into footstones/events/deliverable and identify interdependencies:
a.	We have to have the ingredients list and know the number of guests before we can calculate the ingredients required.
b.	We have to know how much of the ingredients we need and the cost of the ingredients we are going to use before we can calculate the costs.
c.	We have to know how many chefs we will need before we can calculate their pay.
d.	We have to know how many guests are coming so we can choose a spot in the Millenium Center that can accommodate them all, as well as accommodate their schedules.
e.	We have to know our prep time, the number of chefs, how many people will be there, and what time the event will be before we start cooking.
f.	We have to have enough pancakes for everyone.
g.	We have to know how much money the staff gets before we can pay them.
